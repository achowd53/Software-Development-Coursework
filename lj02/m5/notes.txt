Aggregation Framework: Another way to query data in MongoDB, MQL lets you filter and update while Aggregation lets you group, compute, and reshape data
-Syntax: db.collections.aggregate()
-$match lets you find documents that have the fields/valuse in them
-$project lets you choose which fields to output (similar to second field in .find)
-$group lets you group data
	-Grouping by expression: {$group:{_id:"$address.country"}}
	-Counting values in groups: {$group:{_id:"$address.country","count":{"$sum":1}}}

Cursor Methods that come after gettig results
-.sort({"pop":1,"city":-1}); The former sorts in increasing order, the other decreasing
-.limit(n); limit it to n results
*Usually you sort then limit so MongoDB assusmes .limit.sort means .sort.limit

db.collection.createIndex({field:increasing/decreasing order(1/-1)}}
-Creates an index for the field so MongoDB only has to look through the index rather than all documents in the collection

Compound index
-db.collection.createIndex(index1,index2,...)
-Keeps track of all index1s and index2s sorted by index1 then 2

Data is stored in the way that it is used

Upsert
-db.collection.updateOne({query-to-locate},{update},{"upsert":true}}
-"upsert":true doesn't need to be mentioned multiple times, it changes default value

MongoDB is a NoSQL database, doesn't store data in tables, instead puts data in documents (Its a NoSQL DocumentDB)
Documents store data as field, value pairs
Collection stores many documents
Database stores many collections
Atlas is a clud database with MongoDB at its core for data storage and retrieval
Atlas users can deploy clusters which are groups of servers that store your data and are linked as a replica set.
Replica Sets are connected MongoDB instances storing the same data
Instance is a single machine locally or in the cloud, running a certain software
Replica Set helps to keep backups unless anything goes wrong with one of the instances
Atlas:
 -Manages cluster creation
 -Runs and maintains database employment
 -Uses cloud service provider of your choice
 -Experiments with new tools and features

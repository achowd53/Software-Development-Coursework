Notes regarding app.py execution:
    - have to reference path of file if csv file isn't in same directory as app.py
    - learned table structure in html

Notes regarding egoless programming:
    - social interaction is very important
    - programs are subject to objectivity unlike art or writing
    - (IMPORTANT) Being alone makes you blind to your own errors, and others can help you see that.
    - mistakes in code you've written aren't attacks on you.
    - fixing errors is key to making better code, treating those fixes as insults leads to it being stalled
    - be nice when you find errors! Being aggressive about it discourages checking for future errors ;;
    - don't think of it as criticism on you 
    - constructive criticism is always founded, we should learn to accept it.

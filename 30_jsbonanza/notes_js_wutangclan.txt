We made a 99% working version of snake using only js and html (very cool i know).

Something to know:
	- It works 99% of the time. We have no idea why it doesn't the other one percent, but we have been working on this for over a hour.
	- We used event.keyCode, but this function is deprecated unfortunately, however it still works. It was the easiest solution we could find.
	- This is not production ready
	- yes
	- pls give good grade thx
